# ðŸŽ¨ Wireframing in Software Design

## ðŸ§  Introduction
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a **skeletal blueprint** or **visual guide** that represents the structure of a website, web app, or software interface.  
It focuses on the **layout**, **content placement**, and **user interactions** without including detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes act as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on functionality and flow before moving into the detailed design phase.

- Provides a **clear structure** for content and functionality.  
- Facilitates **collaboration and communication** among team members, clients, and developers.  
- Saves time and cost by reducing rework during the design and development stages.
